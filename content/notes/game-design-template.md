A simple template to summarize a game idea and its core elements.

## Elevator pitch

Describe the idea in a single paragraph.

## Core Game Mechanics

Describe each core game mechanic in a single or few paragraphs.

## Start, Middle and End

Describe what the player is focusing on in each of these phases.

## How to Win and Lose

Descibe how the player can win but also lose in the game.

All of these combined should give a good enough picture of what the core game design is, and what is most important to focus on when prototyping the game idea.
