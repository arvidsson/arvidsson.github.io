The idea is basically mixing [Battle of Wesnoth](https://www.wesnoth.org/)'s tactical battles with [Battle Brothers](https://store.steampowered.com/app/365360/Battle_Brothers/)'s sandbox overworld. You recruit units in cities you visit and earn money by doing quests. Battles are dangerous as it's easy to lose units or get them injured with permanent negative effects. Both the high fantasy or grimdark medieval setting would work. It would also be interesting to tone down the luck aspect, to make for more deterministic tactical gameplay but maybe with added randomness of critical hits or other bonuses rather than straight up missing shots. Melee could be more deterministic making it more dangerous than ranged where you miss more easily.
